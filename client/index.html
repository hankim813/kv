          <p>When it comes to me buying anything, the object in question must always fit my self-made brand and strict standards of quality. Each item is analyzed at length to these regulations before a winner may be announced. So, in the months prior to grad school, I set to searching when I realized one key component for success was missing: an adequate, yet sexy backpack.</p>
          <p>In the past I had a simple computer bag that weighed my shoulder down enough to justify a crooked spine. I figured for my new prospect I should at least spread the pounds evenly on my unsuspecting shoulders.</p>
          <p>I looked on all the affordable online stores I could think of—I didn’t dare step foot in a mall for the most unique items can never be found there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p>After hours of online-window-shopping night after night I was beginning to lose confidence. There were either affordable things that had no personality or 1% things that would cost me my personality. Two months had passed; August would have been lost had I not ventured onto an obscure site run by a Uruguayan designer.</p>
          <p>And there, on the last legs of hope, I found what could only be heard of in legends: The One. The supple-leathered bag was even named after my hometown’s punk-rock legacy, Nirvana.</p>
          <p>If that wasn’t convincing as fate, then the intricately hand woven design was. I knew the well-crafted color schemes would fit perfectly my brand. The reward of finally having found such a holy grail erased the painful memories of the arduous search. And so I bought it on the spot and never looked back, my mind relieved at such an appropriate find.</p>
